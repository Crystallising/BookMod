# **The 2b2t Signed Book & Collectibles Network - AutoArchiverBot:**


  This mod was created specifically for The 2b2t Signed Book & Collectibles Network Discord Server, which aims to archive and store valuable items, including books. You can join this discord server through the following link: https://discord.gg/s4pYpwr.

  This mod was designed for 1.12.2 Forge and eases the process of archiving books by seamlessly automatically copying the title and author of signed books upon hovering over them. It also takes screenshots upon hovering which can be used to post in #signedbooks_archive. We plan on integrating this mod with the discord server soon, and for your security, the code is open-source.

# **Usage:**
- To begin automatically listing and screenshotting books, simply execute the command ```/archiver start``` in game, and then proceed to hover over all the books you want to record and screenshot. Once you are done, type ```/archiver stop``` and the book info will be printed to a text file, with a folder containing all the screenshots. The list will be formatted in a way so that you can copy and paste the name and title without any effort. You can find the folder where things are saved by executing the command ```/archiver folder```.

# **Other:**
- Should you have any problems or questions, feel free to contact Crystallising#1380. Special thanks to John200410 for coding the bot.
